## NJS-Framework
Base framework I've set up as a starting point for nodejs projects. Includes, express, express-session, connect-flash, passport, bcrypt, uuid, pug, stylus, nib, socket.io, mongodb, mongoose, gulp, nodemon, jshint, and will auto minify/uglify/obfuscate/validate css and javascript on the server side and client side. The client is currently bootstrap, but can quickly and easily be swapped for any markup boilerplate. There is a very basic login system which could easily be expanded upon.
