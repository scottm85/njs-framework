## NJS-Framework
Base framework I've set up as a starting point for nodejs projects.

### Current packages include:
* Express
* Express-session
* Connect-flash
* Passport
* Passport-local
* bcrypt
* node-uuid
* pug
* stylus
* nib
* socket.io
* mongodb
* mongoose
* gulp
  * gulp-chown
  * gulp-stylus
  * gulp-clean-css
  * gulp-uglify
  * gulp-javascript-obfuscator
  * gulp-rename
  * gulp-jshint
* nodemon
* jshint

While in dev it will auto minify/uglify/obfuscate/validate css and javascript on the server side and client side. The client is currently bootstrap, but can quickly and easily be swapped for any markup boilerplate. There is a very basic login system which could easily be expanded upon.
